        <h1>Ways to sell your soul</h1>
    </header>
    <h1>Terms of Service Agreements</h1>
    <p>
        By far the most accidental of soul sales, terms of service agreements target the average person who is too lazy to read the terms before selling their soul to use whatever software they receive in exchange. Examples include <a href="https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2014/05/13/worst-terms-of-service/index.html">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2014/05/13/worst-terms-of-service/3.html">Instagram</a> with the latter having the ability to sell your photos at one point.

        <h1>College Loans</h1>
        <p>
            As someone who went to an expensive liberal arts college I have experienced firsthand many of the issues with modern colleges. Since 1980 college prices have skyrocketed <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/inflation-rate-passes-growth-of-college-tuition-cost-for-first-time-in-decades-2021-10-26">having increased 1,445%.</a> This coupled with an undergraduate dropout rate of <a href="https://www.thinkimpact.com/college-dropout-rates/">40%</a> means that roughly half of individuals who take out loans won't even end up with a degree.

<h1>Good Old Contracts</h1>
<p>
    The classic way to sell your soul has always been with contracts. Typically with the devil or some eldritch entity on the receiving end of the exchange, its depiction in media is commonplace.
